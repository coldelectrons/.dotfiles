# TODO
- system/security/sshd.nix - see if there is a way to / need for keeping secrets secret.

  - textgen API server
- freecad-realthunder - I have a flake as an input, but it seems I don't yet understand how to make it build as part of the system.
  Also, check the current state of vanilla freecad to see if I still need realthunder's branch.
